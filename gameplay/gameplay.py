In the pastel-paved suburb of Lollipop Circle, a place where gumdrop mailboxes cheerfully wave at passersby and street lamps occasionally sparkle with glitter, lived Stacy—a towering goth girl with a heart big enough to hug a dragon and eyeliner sharp enough to slice a villain in half.
Her neighbors were used to seeing her stomp down the sidewalk in her platform boots, black dress swishing like a storm cloud trying very hard to be dramatic in a place where even the grass smelled faintly of cotton candy.
But today—oh today—Stacy was on a mission.

The Magical Stacy’s Mom (a mysterious artifact shaped like a glowing heart with overwhelmingly MILF-like energy for reasons no one fully understands) had been targeted by a long list of villains:
The Bubblegum Bandit…
Sir Smooch-A-Lot…
Mistress Glitterdoom…
The Swole Necromancer of Flexington…
And like twelve more weirdos.

Stacy couldn’t defend it alone.

She needed a mans!!!
Not just any mans…
A heroic mans…
A cute mans…
A mans who could lift heavy things and maybe her too.
A mans who respected a girl with black lipstick and a scythe collection.

Thus began her flirt-fueled recruitment tour.
